# ob-app-sidecar

This repository shows how to setup and deploy an [Observable
Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework) frontend application with a
backend application written in [Go](https://go.dev), as well as a validator
sample application, onto [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) in a
[sidecar](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying#sidecars) configuration.
[nginx](https://nginx.org) is used as the ingress container and hosts the
statically built Observable Framework application; the backend application and
the validator application are separate sidecars.

```

The application is based on <https://github.com/df-rw/ob-app>.

## Aside: What is a validator application?

The validator application accepts requests from the client and validates them
prior to the request being handed off to the application. What the validation
does is application dependent, and could be anything like a basic auth check, a
cookie check or JWT validation.

The validator application exists _separately_ from the application and proxy;
however the proxy is (and in production, must be!) configured to send all
requests through the validator.

The purpose of having a validator application, aside from it's function, is to
provide a single method of validation that doesn't require changes to a backend
application.

## Prerequisites

For this demo:

- Go (`brew install go` or [rtfm](https://go.dev/doc/install))
- nginx (`brew install nginx` or [rtfm](https://nginx.org/en/docs/install.html))

### Optional

- [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) for rebuilding the Go backend
  application on file changes during development:

```shell
go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
```

Configuration for air is in `./.air.toml`.

## Install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/df-rw/ob-app-sidecar
cd ob-app-sidecar
npm install # install modules for Observable Framework
```

## Local development

For ease of development, each of the nginx, Observable Framework and backend
servers should be started in separate terminals. This allows easy log viewing
of each individual service, as well as restarting only individual services if
required:

```shell
go run ./cmd/web/*.go -p 6082        # (or "air") Start backend server.
npm run dev -- --port 6081 --no-open # Start Observable framework (diff terminal).
nginx -p . -c ./nginx-dev.conf       # Start nginx (diff terminal).
```

How traffic moves through the development environment:

```
----------      ---------------
| client | <--> | nginx proxy |
----------      ---------------
              :6080  ^    ^
                     |    |
                     |    |      ----------------------
                     |    -----> | backend app server |
                     |           ----------------------
                     |        :6082
                     |
                     |           -------------------------------
                     ----------> | Observable Framework server |
                                 -------------------------------
                              :6081
```

- `nginx-dev.conf` is configured to listen on port `6080` for inbound requests,
  and pass off to Observable on port `6081` and the application server on
  `6082`.
- nginx proxies requests from the client to either Observable Framework or the
  application server based on the URL of the request.
- nginx also proxies the Observable Framework websocket connection for live-reloading
  of the frontend. Changes you make to Observable Framework code will be automatically
  reloaded in the client.
- The validator service is [stubbed
  out](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_rewrite_module.html#return) in
  `nginx-dev.conf` and is set to let all requests pass through. You can change this as
  and when required, but the idea is for validation to not get in the way while writing
  your application.

## Adding backend routes

`nginx-dev.conf` is setup to pass any requests starting with `/api/` to the
backend application. If there are specific paths you wish to forward to the
backend application, adjust `nginx-dev.conf` to suit.

## Testing containers

Once you're happy with your application, you may wish to test it locally with
each part of the whole in a separate container. We can do this with
[Docker](https://docker.com).

```
                -------------------------------------------------
                |              -------------------------------- |    --------------------------
----------      |              |  Observable Framework static | |    |  --------------------  |
| client | <--> | --------------- site served from the proxy  | |<-->|  | validator server |  |
----------      | | nginx proxy |------------------------------ |    |  --------------------  |
                | ---------------                               |    --------------------------
                -------------------------------------------------  :8081  validator container
             :8080              ingress container
                                        ^
                                        |
                                        v
                -------------------------------------------------
                |             ----------------------            |
                |             | backend app server |            |
                |             ----------------------            |
                -------------------------------------------------
             :8082           application container
```

- We setup the containers using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
  Configuration is in `compose.yaml`.
- `nginx-docker.conf` is configured to listen on port `8080` for inbound
  requests, pass off application requests to the application server on
  `8082`, with the validation service listening on port `8081`.
- `make docker.build` will build all containers.
- `make docker.up` will run all containers.
- `make docker.down` will stop everything.
- `make docker.clean` will kill everything.

You will need to [setup a `.env`](#dot-env), then open a browser to
<http://localhost:8080>. Click click click.

## Deploy to Cloud Build

Configuration for Cloud Build can be found in `cloudbuild.yaml`. There is also
configuration for the Cloud Run service in `run-service.yaml`. The intended
deployment method is a push to a branch, so a Cloud Build trigger should be
setup to run the deploy on this event.

### Why two Cloud Build files?

New Cloud Run services can be created and updated from Cloud Build using
`gcloud run deploy`. However:

- sidecar deployments using `gcloud run deploy` are [currently in
  preview](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying#multicontainer-yaml);
- sidecar start up order, which is required for our layout, requires specifying
  both container dependencies and startup healthcheck probes.

Container dependencies [can be specified using `gcloud run
deploy`](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/services/containers#gcloud_2)
but [healthchecks cannot, and can only be specified via the console, Terraform
or from a .yaml](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/healthchecks).
We use the service configuration in `run-service.yaml` to specify the startup
probes.

We can't specify the service configuration with `gcloud run deploy`, so have to
use `gcloud services replace` instead to get a new service revision going. This
will only run if the configuration supplied (ie. from `run-services.yaml`)
changes between runs. This is good, as there is no point creating a new Cloud
Run revision if nothing changed. This is bad however, if we make application
changes (ie. to our images) and not to our service; we will build and upload
new images, but the service won't deploy a new revision.

`cloudbuild.yaml` is set to use the `COMMIT_SHA` as the tag for our images. This
value will be whatever the commit checksum is given on the push to repo. This
value is written in `run-sevice.yaml` on each deployment, so our service will
get a new revision each deploy as the configuration has changed.

- [Noted in this SO
question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77550717/gcloud-run-replace-not-deploying-a-new-revision-when-no-change-in-the-file).
- Worth noting that using `:latest` won't work; since this tag will never be
  changed in `run-service.yaml` we end up in the same
  uploaded-new-images-but-no-new-service-revision deployed basket.

- Also worth noting that we don't get any errors if `gcloud services replace`
  didn't start a new revision. You need to check the checksums on the images
  via `gcloud run revisions describe...` to see what images are being used.

## Notes

### Why are there so many Dockerfiles?

| Filename | Porpoise |
| --- | --- |
| `Dockerfile.backend` | Builds the container for the backend application. |
| `Dockerfile.ingress-gcp` | Builds the ingress container on GCP. |
| `Dockerfile.ingress-local` | Builds the ingress container for local (Docker) use. |
| `Dockerfile.validator` | Builds the container for the validator application. |

`Dockerfile.ingress-gcp` differs from `Dockerfile.ingress-local` as they
reference (slightly) different nginx configurations (see below).

### Why are there so many nginx configurations?

| Filename | Porpoise |
| --- | --- |
| `nginx-dev.conf` | nginx configuration for local development environment. |
| `nginx-docker.conf` | nginx configuration for local Docker environment. |
| `nginx-gcp.conf` | nginx configuration for GCP environment. |

Docker compose [creates a network for the
container](https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/). This allows internal
applications to refer to each other by service name as specified in
`compose.yaml`. For instance, we can refer to the backend application with the
service name `backend`. `nginx-docker.conf` is setup like this.

This differs to GCP which uses [localhost and unique port
numbers](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/internet-proxy-nginx-sidecar#configure_the_nginx_ingress_container)
to refer to services. For instance, we refer to the backend application on
server `127.0.0.1`, with the port diferrentiating services. `nginx-gcp.conf` is
setup like this.

### .env

See `.env-sample` for a... sample.

| Name | Value(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OBSERVABLE_TELEMETRY_DISABLE` | `true` or `false` | [Observable Framework Telemetry](https://observablehq.com/framework/telemetry) off or on. |

## TODO

- Rewrite nginx configuration based on local (Docker) deploy or GCP deploy.
